# FreeCAD Assembly 4


This tutorial has moved to [a new repository](https://github.com/Zolko-123/FreeCAD_Examples/blob/master/Asm4_Tutorial2/README.md)

## Tutorial 2

In this tutorial we'll assemble 3 parts inside a single FreeCAD document, and animate the movement using a master sketch:

![](tuto2_final.png)

* the base is fixed and holds 2 axes
* the disk rotates around one of the axes
* the arm can wiggle around the base's other axis
* the disk has a nipple that is prisoner in a slot in the arm
* all 3 parts and the full assembly are in 1 single FreeCAD file
